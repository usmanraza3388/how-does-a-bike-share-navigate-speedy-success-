# how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success-

This project is a capstone project assigned at the end of my training in data science from Google. Initially, the project was R-based but I used Python to this end. The work revolves around assessing the customers behavior of this cyclistic rental bike company for their two types of users: casual riders and subscribed customers. The goal was to analyze the annual data to extract helpful insights that could be used to convert casual riders into subscribing to the membership. 

It covers my skills in data processing, data cleaning, and data visualizations.
