It can be clearly observed from the **mean (ride_length)** for both user types that the avg. ride duration of a member is **12 minutes**. On the other hand, the avg. ride time of a casual user is **1 hr 35 min**.\n2. Also, among the riders **who use the cyclistic the most** are casual riders with ride duration spanning **over days**. Among **first 50 users** who use the bikes more are casual riders. \n3. The **longest ride duration** for casual riders are recorded on **Thursday**, while most of riders who have memberships rides longer on **Sundays**. \n4. Casual riders ride most on Sundays and least at the start of week. On the contrary, annual members rides mostly on weekdays and less on weekends.\n5. There is no significant difference between the **average distance** travelled by each category, but casual riders are taking the lead here, too, by approx. 1 Km.\n6. It has been observed that the **HQ QR Station** was prominent among casual riders; about 3% (3764) of casual riders commute daily to and from this particular station.

They are likely to buy the membership as per their frequecy of using bikes.\n2. The **ride length** of a casual rider (at least first 50) spans over days with largest being **108 days**. They must be using **full-day passes**. One strategy to convert them into regular member is **put a cap on ride duration** for casual users for a day. To use the bike above this limit, they have to buy membership. \n3. Most of the casual riders ride on Sunday. Company can provide **incentives or discounts** to regular members specifically on Sunday to allure the casual rider into buying membership. They will buy the membership for they are the ones who use bike the most on Sunday.\n4. Lastly, it is observed that approx. 3% of the casual riders use the HQ QR station for daily commute. Cyclistic can target these specfic users **offering them special offers**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 3: Digital marketing strategy raise annual subscriptions?\n\nTo convert existing casual riders, Cyclistic need to initialize a specific remarketing campaign tailored for casual riders only.\n\n* First of all, the new **awareness campaign** should be launched via **e-mails**, **personal messages**, and **social media** informing the casual riders of benefits of being an annual members.\n* Create **attractive ads** to post on social media listing **offers and incentives** if they convert into members.\n* Second, inform the casual riders about the limit company is going to apply on time duration on full-day passes with invitation for them to subsribing into membership in order to **ride unlimited**. \n* **Promotions and incentives** campaign specifically for riders who rides on Sunday. **Discounts for annual members on Sunday** to convince casual riders into having a membership.\n* Lastly, prepare a **detailed list of casual commuters who use HQ QR station** the most. Approach them with deals to convert them into members as they are already regular commuters. \n\nIt is all remarketing campaign to make casual users aware of what perks they can enjoy if they get permoted to annual members. Moreover, marketing strategy need to be shifted from general awareness campaign to more specific. ","metadata":{}}]}
